# Alice and Bob play a game with piles of stones. 
# There are an even number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones piles[i].

# The objective of the game is to end with the most stones. 
# The total number of stones across all the piles is odd, so there are no ties.

# Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. 
# Each turn, a player takes the entire pile of stones either from the beginning or from the end of the row.
#  This continues until there are no more piles left, at which point the person with the most stones wins.

# Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return true if Alice wins the game, or false if Bob wins.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: piles = [5,3,4,5]
# Output: true
# Explanation: 
# Alice starts first, and can only take the first 5 or the last 5.
# Say she takes the first 5, so that the row becomes [3, 4, 5].
# If Bob takes 3, then the board is [4, 5], and Alice takes 5 to win with 10 points.
# If Bob takes the last 5, then the board is [3, 4], and Alice takes 4 to win with 9 points.
# This demonstrated that taking the first 5 was a winning move for Alice, so we return true.
# Example 2:

# Input: piles = [3,7,2,3]
# Output: true
