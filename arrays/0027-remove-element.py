# Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. 
# The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

# Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

# Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. 
# The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
# Return k.
# Custom Judge:

# The judge will test your solution with the following code:

# int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
# int val = ...; // Value to remove
# int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
#                             // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

# int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

# assert k == expectedNums.length;
# sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
# for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
#     assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
# }

#USE TWO POINTER to keep track of where to insert
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: list[int], val: int) -> int:
        
        #return the index of the array

        pointer = 0 

        for index, element in enumerate(nums):

            if element != val:
                nums[pointer] = element
                pointer += 1
            
        return pointer
