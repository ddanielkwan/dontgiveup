# You have information about n different recipes. You are given a string array recipes and a 2D string array ingredients. The ith recipe has the name recipes[i], and you can create it if you have all the needed ingredients from ingredients[i]. A recipe can also be an ingredient for other recipes, i.e., ingredients[i] may contain a string that is in recipes.

# You are also given a string array supplies containing all the ingredients that you initially have, and you have an infinite supply of all of them.

# Return a list of all the recipes that you can create. You may return the answer in any order.

# Note that two recipes may contain each other in their ingredients.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: recipes = ["bread"], ingredients = [["yeast","flour"]], supplies = ["yeast","flour","corn"]
# Output: ["bread"]
# Explanation:
# We can create "bread" since we have the ingredients "yeast" and "flour".
