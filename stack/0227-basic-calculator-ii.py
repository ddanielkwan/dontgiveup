# Given a string s which represents an expression, evaluate this expression and return its value. 

# The integer division should truncate toward zero.

# You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of [-231, 231 - 1].

# Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "3+2*2"
# Output: 7
# Example 2:

# Input: s = " 3/2 "
# Output: 1
# Example 3:

# Input: s = " 3+5 / 2 "
# Output: 5
